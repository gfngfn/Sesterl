# git blame master ignore list
#
# This file contains a list of git hashes of revisions to be ignored by git
# blame. These revisions are considered "unimportant" in that they are unlikely
# that they are unlikely to be what you are interested in when blaming.
#
# Instructions:
# - Only large (generally automated) reformatting should be added to this list.
#   Do not put things here just because you feel they are trivial or
#   unimportant. If in doubt, do not put it on this list.
# - Only put full 40-character hashes on this list (not short hashes or any
#   other revision reference).

# First run of dune build @fmt --auto-promote
